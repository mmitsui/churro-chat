# Roadmap — Churro Chat

## MVP (v1)
- Room creation (TTL 12/24/72)
- Immutable share URL
- Anonymous join (random nickname + color)
- Nickname editing
- Real-time messaging (text + emojis + links; no images)
- Owner moderation (eject/ban)
- Guardrails (rate limits, duplicate detection, join throttling)
- Expiration + deletion policy

## v1.1 (likely next)
- Optional room lock (stop new joins)
- Basic reporting (“report message”)
- Better owner recovery (admin link / recovery token)
- Improved link safety UX (warnings, domain reputation hints)

## v2+
- Invite-only mode / passcode rooms
- Threads or lightweight topic pins
- Better moderation tooling and audit trails (privacy-aware)
- Monetization (if desired): branded rooms, capacity upgrades, custom TTL
