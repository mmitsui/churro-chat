# Churro Chat

Churro Chat is a web-based, anonymous, ephemeral chat room you can create and share instantly—no account creation, no app download, mobile-first.

## Core idea
- Create a room → share a URL → anyone can join immediately
- Anonymous participants: randomized nickname + color (nickname editable)
- Rooms expire automatically (12h / 24h / 72h)
- Supports links + emojis (no images)
- Room owner can moderate (eject/ban)
- Guardrails reduce bots, spam, and abuse

## MVP constraints
- Max 300 users per room
- Room URL is immutable once created
- No images/media uploads (links allowed)
